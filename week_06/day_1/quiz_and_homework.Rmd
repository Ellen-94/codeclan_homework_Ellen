# MVP

## The Titanic

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Fig. 1.** The RMS Titanic leaving Southport, 10th April 1912 (public domain)", out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RMS_Titanic.jpg")
```

A data set detailing the survival or death of passengers and crew members on the RMS Titanic is given in the `data` folder for this homework - use this data and **not** the built-in `Titanic` dataset in `R`. 

Some time after the disaster a journalist wrote that crew members were *more likely* to have survived the sinking than passengers. This was disputed by a descendant of one of the surviving crew members, who suggested that the opposite was true, i.e. passengers were *more likely* to have survived than crew.  

**Question**  
Calculate the conditional probabilities $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{survived} \mid \textrm{crew})$ and $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{survived} \mid \textrm{passenger})$ to settle this dispute.

Have a look at the distinct values of the `class` variable, this will tell you whether each individual was a passenger (1st, 2nd or 3rd class) or a member of the crew (treat restaurant staff as crew)


**Loading packages**

You may want to use `prob` and `gtools` later in the homework, and the `tidyverse` for this section.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(gtools)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
source('prob.R') # Remember to modify the path if the prob.R file is in another directory, or copy the file to the necessary location. Consider if the here() function might be useful.
```

<details>
<summary>**Hints**</summary>

* You may want to create a `crew` column containing values `TRUE` or `FALSE` to help with this
* For $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{survived} \mid \textrm{crew})$ think 'what proportion of the crew survived?', and similar for $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{survived} \mid \textrm{passenger})$

```{r}
titanic_data <- read_csv("titanic.csv")

```


```{r}
titanic_data %>% 
distinct(class)

titanic_data_new <- titanic_data %>% 
  mutate(crew = case_when(class == "engineering crew" ~ TRUE, 
         class == "victualling crew" ~ TRUE,
         class == "deck crew" ~ TRUE,
         class == "restaurant staff" ~ TRUE, .default = FALSE))
```



```{r}

# Table 

head(titanic_data_new)

contingency_table <- titanic_data_new %>% 
  tabyl(survived,crew)

contingency_table <- contingency_table %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col"))

contingency_table_percentages <- contingency_table %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator= "all") %>% 
  adorn_title()

# Pipes 

prob_crew_survival <- 
  titanic_data_new %>% 
  filter(crew == TRUE, survived == "yes") %>% 
  summarise(prob = n()/nrow(titanic_data_new))
prob_crew_survival

prob_passenger_survival <- 
titanic_data_new %>% 
  filter(crew == FALSE, survived == "yes") %>% 
  summarise(prob = n()/nrow(titanic_data_new))
prob_passenger_survival

```
The table and calculations shows that crew members were less likely to have survived (about 1% survivors), whereas passengers had about 23 % chance of survival. 

## Probability Consolidation Questions

Today was pretty full-on! Here are some problems to help you consolidate what you learned. Feel free to work on paper or in `R`, whichever you are most comfortable with:

**MVP - try _four_ of the problems**  
**Extension - try more than four!**

<br>
**Question 1.**  
If I roll a six-sided dice once, what is the probability of getting a number less than 5?

```{r}

# get all possible combos 
dice_once <- rolldie(1)

# find number of rows when less than five 
total_less_five <- dice_once %>% 
  filter(X1 < 5)

# number of outcomes / total number of options 

prob_total_five <- nrow(total_less_five)/nrow(dice_once)
prob_total_five

```
The calculation shows that the probability is about 67%. 


**Question 2.**  
How many outcomes are there in the sample space of an experiment in which we toss three dice?

```{r}

# get all possible combos 
dice_three <- rolldie(3)

nrow(dice_three)





```
There are 216 total possible outcomes when three dice are tossed. 


**Question 3.**  
In an experiment where we roll four dice:

  * how many outcomes are in the event where the total of the four dice equals $5$, $6$ or $7$)?
  * what is the probability of this event?
  * what assumptions do we apply in answering part ii?
  
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
For part i, `rowSums(.)` may help you setup up the necessary random variable `total` (or you can use `pivot_longer()`)

```{r}

# get all possible combos 
dice_four <- rolldie(4)

# find number of rows when equals to 5, 6 or 7 
total_event <- dice_four %>% 
  filter(X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 == 5 | 
         X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 == 6 |
         X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 == 7)

# number of outcomes / total number of options 

prob_total <- nrow(total_event)/nrow(dice_four)
prob_total


```
There are 34 possible outcomes in the event where the total of the four dice equals 5, 6 or 7. The probability is about 2.6 %. 


**Question 4.**  
Five chairs are placed in a row in a room, along with five people of differing height. The people sit down randomly on the chairs. What is the probability that they sit in order of decreasing height, left to right?

<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
This is an arrangement where order matters. Of all the possible arrangements, how many are correct?
</details>

```{r}
all_possible <- as_tibble(permutations(n=5, r=5, repeats.allowed = FALSE))

1/120

```
1 out of 120 would be correct, so the probability is 0.0083.  


**Question 5.**  
I roll six dice:

  * what is the probability I see the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 in order on the dice, left to right?
  * what is the probability I see one each of the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 on the dice regardless of order?
  
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
Have a look at the `isin()` function in the `prob.R` file. For example, to `filter` all rows containing $6$, $1$, $2$ in that order, you could use `isin(., c(6, 1, 2), ordered = TRUE)`
</details>

```{r}



# get all possible combos 
dice_six <- rolldie(6)

 # 46,656 

# find number of rows when ordered
total_dice_six <- dice_six %>% 
  filter(isin(., c(6, 5, 4, 3, 2,1), ordered = TRUE)== TRUE)

# number of outcomes / total number of options 

1/46656

# answer is 2.143347e-05

# Regardless of order 

total_dice_six_unordered <- dice_six %>% 
  filter(isin(., c(6, 5, 4, 3, 2,1), ordered = FALSE)== TRUE)

720/46656

# answer is 0.0154321

```



**Question 6.**  
If I draw a single card from a 52-card deck, and it is black, what is the probability that its suit is spades? <br>

<details>
<summary>**Hints**</summary>

* Investigate the `cards()` function in the `prob.R` file, if you'd like to try this in R (make a deck without jokers). 
* You could think about adding your own `black_card` random variable to the sample space, which would be `TRUE` if the `suit` is 'Spade' or 'Club', and `FALSE` otherwise.
</details>

```{r}
 
deck <- cards()

deck_new <- deck %>% 
  mutate(black_card = case_when(suit %in% c("Spade", "Club")  ~ TRUE, .default = FALSE))


#  get all possible outcomes for black card is 26 

deck_new %>% 
  filter(black_card == TRUE)


# probability that it is spades  - there are 13 Spades 

deck_new %>% 
  filter(suit == "Spade")


# # number of outcomes / total number of options 

13/26 


```
