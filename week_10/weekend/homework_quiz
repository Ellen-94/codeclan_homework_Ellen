Homework Quiz 

1. It seems likely that all of those variables would have an impact, but some seem much more than others (eg. reading level compared to gender), so over-fitting is possible.   

2. A smaller AIC indicates a better fit, so I should use the model with the smaller score. 

3. The much lower r-squared value in the second model indicates over-fitting, so I would use the first model with the higher adjusted r-squared. 

4. It is possible that the model is over-fitting, since I would have expected a lower RMSE on the training data. 

5. I'd first pick a k, for example 5. I then split my data into five parts, and make five models. Each time 4 sets of data are trained on the model, and 1 is set aside. I then average the error across test sets. 

6. A validation set is a set of data used neither in taining nor to comapere models, and can tehrefore give a final estimate of mdoel perofmrance. It is used after having selected the model in a more complex model building process. 

7. Backwards selection starts with a model containing all possible predictors. It checks all predictors in the model, finds the one that lowers R@ the least when it's removed, and gradually removes these predictors from the model. 

8. In subset selection, all possible cominations of predictors for the best model are searched for at each size of the model.
