# Homework Info

## Learning Objectives<br>

* Practice making plots with ggplot2
* Create your own theme and use it with plots

## Background

QikBit is a start-up company producing low cost fitness trackers. Their flagship product, the KwikBit Unit1 (spot the mistake on the patent form) reproduces the functionality of the best-in-class commercial fitness trackers, but is cheap to make.  They are currently preparing to pitch to a potential investor and require a selection of charts to include in their presentation and promotional materials.

## Data

The data for this assignment is provided in the `CodeClanData` package.

* `qb_revenue_breakdown`
* `qb_monthly_sales`
* `qb_competitors`
* `qb_device_data`

Take a little time before you start to familiarise yourself with the data.

# MVP

## Part 1

**Question 1.**  
Take the data in the dataset `qb_revenue_breakdown` and make a stacked bar chart showing the sources of revenue across the two years in the dataset.
<br>

```{r}
library(CodeClanData)
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(qb_revenue_breakdown) +
  geom_col(aes(x = Year, y = Revenue, fill = Product))+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Accessories" = "#50434F", "Smart Watches" = "#E89FE9", "Subscription Services" = "#F9A472", "Trackers" = "#BD7040")) +
  labs(title = "Sources of Revenue for 2018 and 2019")+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), title = element_text(size = 14))


```


**Question 2.**  
Make a line chart showing monthly sales of the "flagship product" - the 'KwikBit Unit 1' - over the last year. This data is inside `qb_monthly_sales`, but you will need to use `filter()` or `subset()` (base `R)`.
<br>

```{r}

KwikBit_sales <- 
qb_monthly_sales %>% 
  filter(Cashflow == "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales")

ggplot(KwikBit_sales) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Amount)) +
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Monthly Sales of Flagship Product") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = col_scheme) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), title = element_text(size =14))
  

```


**Question 3.**  
Make a line chart showing monthly revenue and costs over the last year. This data is also in `qb_monthly_sales`.								
```{r}


ggplot(qb_monthly_sales) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Amount, colour = Cashflow)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values =c("#E89FE9", "#F9A472", "#BD7040")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Monthly Revenue and Cost last Year") +
 theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), title = element_text(size = 14))

# Answer 


qb_monthly_sales %>% 
  filter(Cashflow != "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= Date, y = Amount)) +
  geom_line(aes(col = Cashflow)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = Cashflow)) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    expand = c(0,0),
    limits = c(0,3000),
    breaks = seq(0, 3000, 250)
  )
  
  
  
```


**Question 4.**  
Show annual sales of personal fitness trackers over the last 5 years broken down by company as a ribbon plot (use `geom_area`). This data is in `qb_competitors`.
<br>

```{r}

ggplot(qb_competitors, aes(x=Year, y=Revenue, group = Company, fill = Company)) +
  geom_area(alpha=0.5, color="black", size=1)+
  labs(title = "Annual Sales of Personal Fitness Trackers by Company") +
  scale_fill_manual(values =c("Competitor 1" = "#E89FE9", "Competitor 2" = "#50434F", "Competitor 3" = "#F9A472", "Competitor 4" = "#BD7040")) +
  theme_minimal()
  

# Answer 

options(scipen =10)
qb_competitors %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= Year, y = Revenue, fill = Company)) +
  geom_area() +
  theme_classic()


```


**Question 5.**  
Now show the sales from the four competitors as a line graph. Include an extra layer that shows the data points used to make the lines.
<br>

```{r}
ggplot(qb_competitors) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = Revenue, colour = Company))+
  geom_point(aes(x = Year, y = Revenue, colour = Company))+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_colour_manual(values = col_scheme) +
  labs(title = "Annual Sales of Personal Fitness Trackers by Company")+
   theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), title = element_text(size = 14))

```


**Question 6.**  
Now the company wants to compare the number of steps that their device counts vs. their competitors. Make a line graph of the number of steps throughout time, and use faceting to compare between companies and people. The data for this is in `qb_device_data`.
<br>

```{r}

ggplot(qb_device_data) +
  geom_line(aes(x = mins, y = counts, colour = id))+
   facet_wrap(~ device, nrow = 1)+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_colour_manual(values = col_scheme)+
  labs(title = "Number of Steps per Device by Company and Person")+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), title = element_text(size = 14))

# Answer 

qb_device_data %>% 
  mutate(decimal_hour = hours + (mins/60)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = decimal_hour, y = counts)) + 
  geom_line(aes(col = device)) + 
  facet_grid(device ~ id)

```


## Part 2 

**Question 1.**  
Take the plots that you produced in part one and now polish them by:

1. Adding appropriate labels
2. Changing the scales and coordinates when appropriate.
3. Applying a unified theme, which is described below:
  * Graphs should have white backgrounds, and use colour sparingly.
  * There should be faint grid lines.
  * Font sizes should be ~12pt although titles should be slightly larger and axis labels can be slightly smaller. 
  * All plots should use colours from the following company colour scheme.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("palette.JPG")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
col_scheme <- c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040")

# create theme

theme_corporate <-  theme( 
  text = element_text(size = 12), 
  title = element_text(size = 14),
  axis.text = element_text(size = 9), 
  panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"), 
  panel.grid = element_line(colour = "grey80")
  
  )
  
  
```
<br>

# Extension

**Question 1.**  
Try out different ways of plotting these three datasets. Which graphs do you think are particularly effective at showing QikBit's success?
<br>
